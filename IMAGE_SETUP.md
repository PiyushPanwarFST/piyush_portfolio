# Image Setup Instructions

## Profile Image

To add your profile image to the portfolio:

1. Place your profile image in the `/public` folder
2. Name it `profile.jpg` (or update the path in `components/Hero.tsx`)
3. Recommended size: 400x400px or larger (square image works best)
4. The image will automatically display in the hero section

If no image is found, your initials "RT" will be displayed as a fallback.

## Favicon

The favicon has been created with your initials "RT" in a gradient design. It's located at:
- `/public/favicon.svg` (SVG version)
- `/public/favicon.ico` (ICO version)

The favicon will automatically appear in browser tabs.
